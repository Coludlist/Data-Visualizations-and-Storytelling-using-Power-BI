# Data-Visualizations-and-Storytelling-using-Power-BI

Load the CSV data into Power BI.
Then I created a chart for Storytell for the superstore using 4 KPI cards on the right side
sales by state by map, the top 10 customers using a bar chart, sales and profit by order date using an area chart, sales by sub category using a treemap, and also added interactive filters, "slicers".
Test the Story: Now, interact with your report.
​Start with the total numbers: $2.3M in Sales.
​Click on "Technology" in the "Sales by Category" donut chart.
​Watch how every other visual instantly filters. The map now shows only technology sales, the trendline updates, and the Top 10 customer list changes.
